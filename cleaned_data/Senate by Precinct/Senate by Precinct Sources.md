The files '2016 Senate.csv', '2018 Senate.csv', '2020 Senate.csv', and '2022 Senate.csv' contain aggregated county-level election results for the U.S. Senate. 

Preliminary validation (testing.py and 'testing results.png') suggest that the data is reasonably accurate in terms of total votes and vote allocation by party. The absentee/early/mail-in vote results are very poor. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear but likely related to the way that voting 'mode' is reported inconsistently across counties.
