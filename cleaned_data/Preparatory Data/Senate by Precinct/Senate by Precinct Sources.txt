RESULTS

Preliminary validation (testing.py and 'testing results.png') suggest that the data is reasonably accurate in terms of total votes and vote allocation by party. The absentee/early/mail-in vote results are very poor. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear but likely related to the way that voting 'mode' is reported inconsistently across counties.
